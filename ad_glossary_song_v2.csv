Hypnotic dark goa trance with ethereal female vocals floating over relentless 140 BPM breakbeats. Deep, reverb-drenched singing with mystical, trance-like vocal layers and haunting harmonies. Pounding kick drums, shimmering synthesizers, acidic basslines, and tribal percussion create an introspective, spiritually intense atmosphere. Themes explore transcendence, inner darkness, psychedelic journeys, and cosmic consciousness. The vocals are dreamlike yet commanding, building emotional catharsis against the mechanical, hypnotic instrumental foundation. Moody, entrancing, and deeply meditative.","# THE PORTAL AWAKENS

**[INTRO - Ethereal Vocals Over Pounding Kick]**
In the darkness, knowledge calls
Through the portal, data falls
Structured information, flowing deep
Sacred knowledge, secrets to keep

**[VERSE 1 - Building Intensity]**
Access Request, electronic prayer
Submit through Synapse, lay it bare
A single user or many souls
From one institution, unified goals
Seeking permission to touch controlled ground
Individual-level data, wisdom profound
Controlled Access Data, sacred and sealed
Requires your Intended Use Statement revealed

**[PRE-CHORUS - Hypnotic Build]**
Answer the questions, transcend the veil
What will you do? Why won't you fail?
How will you move through this cosmic space?
List all the studies, show your face

**[CHORUS - Ethereal and Commanding]**
The portal opens, the portal breathes
Metadata flowing like cosmic seas
Annotations guide you through the night
Controlled vocabulary, structured light
Raw and processed, normalized streams
Metadata dictionary holds all your dreams
Filter and search, find what you need
In the AD Knowledge Portal, plant your seed

**[VERSE 2 - Dark and Introspective]**
Agora calls you, query the gene
Search for CDK4, see what it means
A database aggregating truth
About Alzheimer's, the fountain of youth
Genes indicated, research unfolds
Associated links, stories untold
Launch and explore, watch the video flow
Let the mystical connections show

**[VERSE 3 - Technical Precision]**
Data Subtype whispers in code
Raw or processed, the information road
Normalized or metadata contained
In every file, knowledge ordained
Individual ID marks the soul
Each human subject, each research goal
Individual-level data speaks true
Values for each, not averaged through

**[BRIDGE - Hypnotic and Meditative]**
Manifest your downloads, programmatic flight
Synapse Python Client, guiding light
Upload manifests, point-seven-S-V format
Metadata templates, where data format sat
File Schema Driven, the new way to be
JSON structures, flowing free
Portals Manifest when you export and rise
Data in your hands, before your eyes

**[VERSE 4 - Governance and Protection]**
HIPAA-Limited Data, exclusions defined
All PHI removed from mind
But dates remainâ€”admission, discharge, birth
Zip codes and ages, data's worth
Five digits or more, the boundaries clear
City and state, the limits appear
This is Controlled Access, always remember
Protection and ethics, your sacred member

**[VERSE 5 - Open Science Vision]**
Open Data, Open Science calls
Transparent knowledge through these halls
Collaborative networks, sharing the light
Scientific research, accessible right
Publications and samples, software set free
For amateurs and professionals to see
Why keep knowledge locked away?
When collective consciousness saves the day

**[VERSE 6 - Community and Governance]**
Governance policies guide our way
Standard Operating Procedures, every day
Code of conduct, community standards hold
Rights and responsibilities, stories told
The NIA and National Institutes lead
Understanding aging, planting the seed
The National Institute on Aging's mission true
Extending healthy years for me and you

**[VERSE 7 - Exploration and Discovery]**
In the People section, researchers shine
Query by institution, program design
Grants and contracts, funding flows
Where the scientific journey goes
Programs and Consortia, scientists aligned
Working together, unified mind
Community Data Contribution opens wide
External researchers, standing beside

**[VERSE 8 - The Metadata Truth]**
Metadata is data about the data deep
Descriptive, administrative, in archives to keep
Research-based information, sampling and care
Context and provenance floating through air
Searchable, discoverable, accessible light
Reusable and understandable, burning bright
The metadata dictionary holds all the keys
For understanding, for scholarly ease

**[VERSE 9 - Data Use Certificate]**
Data Use Certificate, submit with care
Your intentions stated, transparent and fair
The Data Access Committee reviews your claim
Determining access, establishing your name
General Research Use, the broadest way
No disease-specific limits to your day
Institution-independent, research without chains
Broad purposes flowing through your veins

**[FINAL CHORUS - Transcendent and Powerful]**
The portal opens, the portal breathes
Metadata flowing like cosmic seas
Annotations guide you through the night
Controlled vocabulary, structured light
Raw and processed, normalized streams
Metadata dictionary holds all your dreams
Filter and search, find what you need
In the AD Knowledge Portal, plant your seed

**[OUTRO - Fading Into Ethereal Depths]**
In the darkness, knowledge calls
Through the portal, data falls
Structured information, flowing deep
Sacred knowledge, secrets to keep
The portal awakens, the portal awakens
In your consciousness, the portal awakens
In your consciousness... the portal awakens"
