https://help.synapse.org/docs/API-Clients-and-Documentation.1985446128.html,"**Singer-Songwriter | Intimate Acoustic Ballad**

Slow, contemplative tempo (60-70 BPM). Raw, emotionally vulnerable vocals with subtle vibrato and occasional vocal breaks. Fingerpicked acoustic guitar as primary instrument with minimal production—perhaps delicate strings or light piano underneath. Warm, nostalgic atmosphere with introspective mood. Lyrics explore personal reflection, lost love, self-discovery, and life's quiet moments. Intimate like bedroom pop but grounded in folk authenticity. Vocals should feel conversational and honest, as if confiding directly to the listener. Sparse arrangement emphasizes lyrical storytelling and emotional nuance over production polish.","# API Client's Lament

*(Verse 1)*
There's a tool I've been learning to hold
A way to talk to Synapse, or so I'm told
Instead of clicking through the interface all day
There's a set of remote controls I can say
Commands in a language my computer understands
Upload, download, organize with my hands
Just typing out scripts instead of the grind
Leaving all that manual labor behind

*(Chorus)*
An API client is what I need
When I'm drowning in data, when I'm planting a seed
Of research that's honest, that's reproducible and true
Sharing my scripts so others can move through
The same steps, the same way, the same output too
An API client, it's carrying me through

*(Verse 2)*
When you've got hundreds of files to move
One by one would take years to prove
But the client handles batches so clean
Automatic and fast, if you know what I mean
It won't stumble or tire or make a mistake
When the stakes are so high and so much is at stake
Large-scale transfers, that's where it shines
Feeding data through analysis pipelines

*(Chorus)*
An API client is what I need
When reproducibility's the promise I plead
Same data, same steps, same scientific light
Transparency and trust, getting this right
Sharing my work so the world can see
An API client is freeing me

*(Verse 3)*
There's the command line if you want to connect
Straight to Synapse, keeping things direct
Python client if that's your native tongue
R client too, for the work that's begun
REST API docs if you're building your own
Creating connections where seeds have been sown
Manage your credentials, keep them secure
These are the tools that will help you endure

*(Verse 4)*
The R client sits on Python's foundation
Through reticulate, a careful translation
Multi-threaded uploads, file caching so smart
Engineering solutions from the start
If troubles arise, the Python path's clear
More actively developed, the most engineers near
But we're working to smooth every friction away
In both ecosystems, every single day

*(Bridge)*
Install them carefully, manage your space
Store your credentials in a safe place
Connect to the bigger picture, the pipeline, the dream
Where Synapse flows into your whole processing stream
Not just a website, not just a click
But a language, a rhythm, a systematic trick

*(Final Chorus)*
An API client is what I've come to know
When my research needs room to grow
Automation, integration, reproducible light
Scripts that tell the story right
Sharing with colleagues, with the world at large
An API client puts me in charge
In charge of my data, in charge of my way
An API client carries me through every day

*(Outro)*
Yeah, there's a tool I've been learning to hold
A way to talk to Synapse, more precious than gold
Commands in a language my computer understands
The future of research is finally in my hands"

Making research transparent, that's a must
Tracking every change, every hand that touched the line
Understanding how a dataset grows through time

**Chorus**
Oh, Synapse, you're the place where we belong
Where data lives together, where we all are strong
Share your code and datasets, annotate and query here
Even if it's scattered, we can see it clear
Synapse, oh, Synapse, collaborative ground
Where reproducible science can be found

**Verse 2**
You can access it through REST Application Programming Interface
Python client, R client, command line—take your pick, it's nice
Integrate it with your workflow, your analytics and your code
A programmer's pathway down a well-constructed road

**Pre-Chorus**
Tracking who did what, and when they changed the way
Every modification, every single day
Governance and policies protecting what we hold
Sensitive data safe, but shared and bold

**Chorus**
Oh, Synapse, you're the place where we belong
Where data lives together, where we all are strong
Share your code and datasets, annotate and query here
Even if it's scattered, we can see it clear

Comparing algorithms, making breakthroughs sweet

**Verse 3**
Control who can access, decide how data's used
Built-in governance features, no data will be abused
Monitoring compliance, setting policies with care
Ethical responsibility—it's woven everywhere
Small private teams or global consortia wide
Synapse is the center where we all reside

**Final Chorus**
Oh, Synapse, you're the place where we belong
Where data lives together, where we all are strong

**[Verse 1]**
When you gather all your data, scattered far and wide
Key and value pairs are waiting, let them be your guide
Species, assay, file format—structure brings you peace
Search through all your memories, let the questions cease
BAM files from RNA sequencing, samples stacked so high
Human-readable names won't help you find them, that's why
You need annotations, systematic ways to organize
Metadata that opens up before your very eyes

**[Pre-Chorus]**
Take it step by step, build it carefully
Store your information, let it flow so naturally

**[Chorus]**
Annotations help you find what matters most
Every key and value, every little post
Group and describe the things you hold so dear
Web or programmatic clients bring it near
Annotations, they're the way to make it real
Structured information, help you feel
The power of your data organized with care
Annotations everywhere, they're everywhere

**[Verse 2]**
In the web client, find the Tools up in the corner high
Select Annotations there and watch your metadata fly
Click on Edit, add your pairs one by one with grace
Use the plus icon when you need another place
Multiple values for a single key so true
Press the X to remove what you no longer choose
Add a New Key when you're ready to expand
Bulk update your files using views, it's all so planned

**[Pre-Chorus]**
Take it step by step, build it carefully
Store your information, let it flow so naturally

**[Chorus]**
Annotations help you find what matters most
Every key and value, every little post
Group and describe the things you hold so dear
Web or programmatic clients bring it near
Annotations, they're the way to make it real
Structured information, help you feel
The power of your data organized with care
Annotations everywhere, they're everywhere

**[Verse 3]**
From the command line, store your file with annotations set
Synapse store the file name with your parent ID, don't forget
Pass your format and your assay in quotation marks so clear
JSON structure holds the meaning, crystal in appearance
Or set annotations on existing files with ease
Synapse set-annotations will put your mind at peace
Specify the ID and your key-value pairs aligned
Documentation and precision, leaving nothing behind

**[Verse 4]**
In the Python client, create your entity first
File path and the parent, quench your data's thirst
Set annotations as a dictionary, store it all with care
Then synapse store will upload it into the air
Or retrieve an entity, get the annotations there
Modify the values, update with your prayer
Set the annotations back, the changes now complete
Python's programmatic power makes your workflow sweet

**[Verse 5]**
In the R client, build your entity the same
File path and parent ID establish its name
Synapse Store with annotations listed in your call
Modify existing files, you can change it all
Get the annotations first, preserve what's already there
Combine the existing with the new you declare
Synapse Set Annotations, add without erasing past
Or replace them entirely, let the new ones last

**[Bridge]**
Ontologies and vocabularies guide your way
Controlled vocabulary or custom as you say
Metadata that evolves with your research as it grows
Flexibility and structure, that's how knowledge flows
Batching and automation when you use command line
Thousands of your files will organize just fine
Views for bulk updating, managing at scale
With annotations, your data will never fail

**[Final Chorus]**
Annotations help you find what matters most
Every key and value, every little post
Group and describe the things you hold so dear
Web or programmatic clients bring it near
Annotations, they're the way to make it real
Structured information, help you feel
The power of your data organized with care
Annotations everywhere, they're everywhere

Yes, annotations everywhere
Metadata with love and care
Searching through the data finds
Everything that's on your mind
Annotations everywhere
They're everywhere

*(Verse 1)*
Baby, let me set the scene, we need authentication
First thing that we gotta do is create preparation
Go to Synapse under Settings, get your personal access token
That's your Auth Token, baby, that's the key we're holdin'
Make sure that it's got the view scope, minimum requirement
Download and Modify permissions, that's the vibe we're livin' in
Now we're ready, now we're steady, got what we need to start
Let me show you all the ways to open up this heart

*(Pre-Chorus)*
Multiple methods, multiple ways
I'm gonna love you through these login days
Choose the one that fits your flow
Let me take you where you wanna go

*(Chorus)*
Synapse, you got me open, programmatically
I'm connecting to your API, so intimately
Python, R, command line, baby, pick your lane
Every authentication method got the same refrain
Synapse, yeah, we're syncing up, moving smooth and slow
Let me show you every method, let your access grow
Synapse, you got me open, yeah, you got me here
Every single login option, crystal clear

*(Verse 2)*
Python lovers, listen close, use synapseclient
Import it and call that login function, it's so reliant
Pass your auth token as a parameter, watch it flow
Returns a welcome message, now you're in the glow
Or if you're command line, type synapse login
Pass your token with the dash-p flag, let the session begin
R users, grab synapser, call synLogin with your token
That's the authentication language that we're speakin'

Now let me tell you 'bout the config, the real smooth move
Create a dot-synapseConfig file, set your groove
In your home directory, hidden system file
Keeps your credentials safe, keeps 'em out of sight
Store your access token there, don't put it in your code
Share your work with others, keep that burden light on load
Set your cache location, third-party credentials too
Everything you need is in that hidden file with you

Environment variables, another way to go
Set that Synapse Auth Token, let your access flow
Open up your shell config, bashrc or zsh
Add that export statement, make it splash
The token takes priority, takes it over config

R users in Rstudio, you got your own way
Save it in dot-Renviron file, every single day
Environment variable's set, now you're ready to connect
Call synLogin with no parameters, show some respect
All these methods working together in harmony
Multiple authentication pathways set you free
Choose the workflow that feels natural to you
Every single option's gonna see you through

In the realm of cloud and data vast,
A gateway opens from the past,
Synapse calls with ancient might,
Security Token Service burning bright!
Login first with power true,
Credentials waiting there for you,
Create an empty folder strong,
Where the STS path belongs!

**[Pre-Chorus]**
Write access you must claim,
Before you speak the folder's name,
Prepare the destination field,
Let the epic quest be sealed!

**[Chorus]**
Rise up with temporary credentials!
Twelve hours of power, exponential!
S3 storage, read-only or read-write,
Synapse managed or external might!
Download in bulk, upload the tide,
Compute cluster by your side,
Temporary AWS credentials—
THE LEGENDARY ESSENTIALS!

**[Verse 2]**
For Synapse-managed storage, hear the call,
Set the upload type to S3 for all,
Enable STS with boolean true,
Concrete type—the storage view!
Call the REST endpoint with might,
Post to storage location right,
Then set the project destination,
The upload settings configuration!

**[Bridge - Building Intensity]**
External bucket? Bold and free!
Connect your S3 directly!
Specify the bucket name,
Enter base key—stake your claim!
If no base key guards the way,
Users access all—beware this day!
Folder path within your store,
Scope the access to what's yours!

**[Verse 3]**
With Python rise or R ascend,
Import the clients, call the trend,
Login to Synapse, authenticate,
Your folder ID—designate!
Create destination with the code,
REST POST down the sacred road,
Storage location ID returned,
Now the next step must be learned!

**[Chorus 2]**
Rise up with temporary credentials!
Twelve hours of power, exponential!
Boto3 client or Java's call,
Access key and secret sprawl!
Session token in your hand,
Download files across the land,
Temporary AWS credentials—
THE LEGENDARY ESSENTIALS!

**[Verse 4]**
Get the endpoint, make the quest,
Entity slash STS, pass the test,
Permission parameter—read-only's way,
Or read-write if data you'll convey!
Access key identification,
Secret access verification,
Session token for the throne,
Temporary power you have known!

**[Bridge 2 - Technical Triumph]**
Never mix the upload methods bold,
Synapse website and S3 untold!
Folder structure will confuse,
One path only—that's the ruse!

Auto-folders created new,
Direct S3 uploads may not align,

https://help.synapse.org/docs/Creating-and-Managing-Wikis.1975746682.html,"**GRUNGE VOCAL STYLE**

Angst-ridden grunge rock with raw, distorted guitars and thunderous drums. Lead vocals delivered with gritty intensity—breathy, pained, and emotionally vulnerable, occasionally cracking with raw emotion. Tempo: slow to mid-tempo (80-100 BPM), heavy and brooding. Instrumentation: thick power chords, fuzzy bass lines, crashing cymbals, minimalist verses building to explosive choruses. Mood: dark, introspective, cathartic despair mixed with defiant anger. Lyrics explore inner turmoil, alienation, societal disillusionment, and existential struggle. Vocal delivery emphasizes authenticity over polish—whispered verses explode into anguished, wailing choruses. Production should feel live and unpolished, capturing raw 90s grunge aesthetic.","# WIKI PAGES (THE BURDEN OF DOCUMENTATION)

**[VERSE 1 - Whispered, breathy]**
Don't put protected human data in these Synapse Wikis
Narrative space for your project, yeah, it's getting real tricky
Plain text, basic HTML, or Markdown will do
Formatting guide's right there, shortcuts breaking through
Heading, bold, italic, strike-through the lies
Code blocks and subscript, superscript rise

**[PRE-CHORUS - Building tension]**
It inherits, it inherits from the project above
Sharing settings cascade down, can't separate love
View permissions or greater, that's the price you pay
Public projects expose it all, night and day

**[CHORUS - Explosive, anguished wailing]**
WIKI! WIKI! Building pages in the dark!
WIKI! WIKI! Leave your documentation mark!
Synapse ID, unique identifier burning bright
Every page you're creating holds the light!
Click that Wiki tab and edit what you've got
Don't delete what you need, give it all you've got!

**[VERSE 2 - Gritty, pained delivery]**
Click the Wiki tab within your project, navigate the Tools menu
Edit Project Wiki, make it your home page, yeah it's catching you
Subpages nested down the left side, links in order they were born
Wiki Tools, add subpages, building hierarchies torn
Synapse ID in the URL bar, project ID showing through
Wiki path and page ID, every reference leading true

**[PRE-CHORUS]**
Preview before you save it, don't destroy what you made
Delete Wiki Page under Tools when it starts to fade
Command line won't support creation, that's the way it goes
Python code with synapseclient, store it as it flows

**[CHORUS]**
WIKI! WIKI! Building pages in the dark!
WIKI! WIKI! Leave your documentation mark!
Synapse ID, unique identifier burning bright
Every page you're creating holds the light!
Click that Wiki tab and edit what you've got
Don't delete what you need, give it all you've got!

**[VERSE 3 - Raw, cracking emotion]**
Python code: import synapseclient, login to the pain
Create Wiki with title, owner, markdown in your vein
Store it, save it, push it through the system's veins
Synapse client holding everything you've chained
R code too: library synapser, synLogin your soul
Wiki with owner, title, markdown makes it whole
synStore your wiki, programmatic despair
Building documentation nobody will repair

**[BRIDGE - Minimalist, building dread]**
Edit Order button, change the hierarchy
Arrow buttons moving pages, left and right, you'll see
Nest them deeper, promote them higher in the tree
Only editors can move them, only editors are free
Changing order doesn't change the synID, no
That unique identifier stays below

**[VERSE 4 - Intense, defiant]**
Widgets supplement your markdown, customize the space
Insert menu at the top, find your saving grace
Attachments, button links, collapsible sections too
Entity lists, file preview, genome browser through
Images embedded, JPG, PNG, GIF or SVG
Join Team buttons, provenance graphs, references to dig
Simple plots from files or tables, submit to Evaluation
Team badges, member counts, user tags for documentation

**[VERSE 5 - Whispered vulnerability]**
Table widgets embed your data, quick access to the files
Paste tab-delimited content or select from Synapse aisles
Query on a table or a view, display information wide
Table of Contents linking headers, nowhere left to hide
Experimental mode in lower right, click it and you'll see
Widgets still in development, use with caution, be free
They may change in future upgrades, data could be lost
Building wikis on Synapse, that's the documentation cost

**[FINAL CHORUS - Maximum intensity, wailing]**
WIKI! WIKI! Building pages in the dark!
WIKI! WIKI! Leave your documentation mark!
Synapse ID, unique identifier burning bright
Every page you're creating holds the light!
Click that Wiki tab and edit what you've got
Don't delete what you need, give it all you've got!
WIKI! WIKI! Narrative content won't die!
WIKI! WIKI! Synapse project, reaching sky!

Mid-tempo hip-hop (90 BPM) with introspective, socially aware lyricism. Vocals feature smooth, articulate delivery with dynamic flow switches—conversational verses building to anthemic, sung choruses. Production blends soulful jazz samples, crisp trap beats, and atmospheric strings. Deep, reflective mood exploring systemic injustice, personal growth, and collective responsibility. Themes include social commentary, mental health awareness, community empowerment, and breaking cycles. Rich vocal layering with harmonies on hooks. Instrumentation: organic boom-bap drums, warm bass, piano flourishes, vinyl crackle. Poignant yet hopeful atmosphere balancing urgency with wisdom.","# SYNAPSE DATA GOVERNANCE

**[INTRO - Atmospheric strings with vinyl crackle]**

*Yeah, yeah... data access, responsibility*
*Governance flows through the system, you see*
*Yeah, yeah... sharing settings define the way*
*What gets locked down, what's on display*

**[VERSE 1 - Conversational, building momentum]**

Listen, when you create a project in Synapse, understand the foundation
Default setting's private access, that's your first designation
Only you and selected users that you authorize can view
Data set to private means nobody else gets through
But there's layers to protection, two-tier restriction
Sharing settings first, then conditions—that's the distinction

You can control who views, who edits, who downloads data
Who deletes files, that's the power you're granted, yeah
Add another shield with conditions for use
Institutional Review Board approval, that's the proof
Data contributors define the rules of engagement
Both restrictions must be met, that's the arrangement

**[CHORUS - Sung, anthemic with layered harmonies]**

Data access types, they guide the way
Sharing settings and conditions every single day
Private, controlled, open, anonymous too
Each one serving different purposes, it's true
Govern responsibly, that's the mission
Protect the vulnerable through governance vision
Two layers of protection keeping data right
Synapse governance shining bright

**[VERSE 2 - Smooth flow with dynamic switches]**

Controlled access data, that's sensitive terrain
Human data with restrictions, potential for pain
Re-identification risks, genetic sequence codes
Data from vulnerable populations bearing heavy loads
Informed consent restrictions, legal agreements tied
Data contributors specify how it's applied
Registered users, certified and validated too
Must request access individually—that's what they do
Cannot redistribute, that's non-negotiable
Misuse could harm participants, that's undeniable

Open access available to registered users free
No additional limitations, just accessibility
Model organism data, non-biological files
De-identified human data with no restrictions or trials
Self-contributed, unambiguously consented for share
Open data sharing, transparent and fair

**[VERSE 3 - Reflective, building awareness]**

Anonymous access opens wider than before
Anyone can download without registered doors
Wiki content, metadata, announcements released
Public domain data, restrictions decreased
Contact the Access and Compliance Team
Act at Sagebase dot org—that's the scheme
To make your open data available that way
Anonymous users accessing every day

But understand the weight of what you share
Genetic data, health information—handle with care
Conditions for use define the boundaries clear
Institutional Review Board approval appears here
Sharing settings authorize the view
Permissions granted, responsibilities too
Both layers must align for access granted
Governance protecting those who can't be supplanted

**[CHORUS - Sung, anthemic repeat]**

Data access types, they guide the way
Sharing settings and conditions every single day
Private, controlled, open, anonymous too
Each one serving different purposes, it's true
Govern responsibly, that's the mission
Protect the vulnerable through governance vision
Two layers of protection keeping data right
Synapse governance shining bright

**[BRIDGE - Introspective, piano flourishes]**

Four types flowing through the system
Private keeps it locked, only you listen
Controlled requires conditions, approval, trust
Open shares with registered users, that's a must
Anonymous goes further, no registration walls
Synapse governance answering the calls
Of those who need protection, those who share
Responsible data sharing everywhere

**[OUTRO - Atmospheric, fading]**

Data access types, responsibility
Sharing settings define who can see
Conditions for use establish the way
Governance protecting data every day
Yeah, yeah... Synapse governance vision
Two layers of protection, that's the mission
Yeah, yeah... share responsibly, truly"

*(Verse 1)*
Oh, in Synapse there lies a collection so fair,
Files gathered together with such tender care,
From projects and folders, they drift through the air,
A dataset's a treasure beyond all compare,
You need only read access to make something rare,
Immutable versions that float like a prayer...

*(Pre-Chorus)*
Oh, can you see it? The draft turning stable,
A snapshot in time, a digital fable,
With versions and DOI numbers so able,
To connect with the world what you've carefully labeled...

*(Chorus)*
Create and distribute, collect and combine,
Across disparate folders, let your files align,
Select the specific versions you want to define,
Up to ten thousand files in your dataset design,
Share with the community, make something divine,
A stable version minted, eternally mine...

*(Verse 2)*
First navigate to your project, so bright,
Click on the Datasets tab, hold it tight,
Click Add Dataset and enter the light,
A name for your collection, everything right,
You'll see the draft banner, a beautiful sight,
But don't share externally until versions are right...

*(Pre-Chorus)*
Oh, can you build it? The structure so stable,
Add Items and browse through each folder and table,
Select individual files, check each checkbox label,
See all the contents, make selections that're able...

*(Chorus)*
Create and distribute, collect and combine,
Across disparate folders, let your files align,
Select the specific versions you want to define,
Up to ten thousand files in your dataset design,
Share with the community, make something divine,
A stable version minted, eternally mine...

*(Verse 3)*
You can search for the files that you need,
Through projects and folders, plant every seed,
The dropdown arrow reveals what you'll read,
Selected items appear at the base of your deed,
Remove what you don't want, proceed with such speed,
Then Save and return to your draft, yes indeed...

*(Bridge)*
Oh, the file view is different, remember this well,
It updates continuously, under its spell,
But a dataset's immutable, a static shell,
With versioning snapshot that stories will tell,
A DOI minted like a crystalline bell,
Stable versions forever, where data will dwell...

*(Verse 4)*
Before you create that stable release,
Edit the schema, find metadata peace,
Add annotations for queries to increase,
Create wiki documentation, let searching not cease,
The draft can be edited before your caprice,
But stable's forever—a beautiful lease...

*(Verse 5)*
Click Dataset Tools, select Create Version there,
Add a label, a comment with utmost care,
The version number's added beyond your compare,
See history unfolding, transparent and fair,
Deleted files show metadata still in the air,
But physical presence—handle with prayer...

*(Final Chorus)*
Create and distribute, collect and combine,
Across disparate folders, let your files align,
Select the specific versions you want to define,
Up to ten thousand files in your dataset design,
Share with the community, make something divine,
A stable version minted, eternally mine...
A stable version minted, eternally mine...

*(Outro)*
Oh, datasets and file views, each have their place,
Choose wisely which tool will best serve your case,
Immutable collections, a permanent grace,
In Synapse's gardens, we find our space...
Follow the Conditions of Use through this embrace,
And your dataset will shine with such beautiful face..."

**[VERSE 1 - CALL]**
Oh, tell me now, what's this identifier?
A Digital Object Identifier, taking us higher
A persistent marker for the digital soul
A unique assignment making knowledge whole

**[VERSE 1 - RESPONSE]**
It's a location defined, a description so clear
Attribution and dates that we all hold dear
In Synapse it lives with a prefix so true
Doi:ten point seven three zero three, leading me to you

**[CHORUS]**
Mint it, mint it, let the object shine
Create that DOI, make it yours and mine
Projects and files, folders and views
Tables and data, spreading the news
From Synapse to the world, let the knowledge flow free
Persistent and present for all we can see

**[VERSE 2 - CALL]**
Take me to the data that I need to find
Tell me how to mint it, ease my mind

**[VERSE 2 - RESPONSE]**
Navigate to what you want to share
From the Tools Menu, show you care
Select Create DOI, let it be known
Or from Project Settings, claim it as your own
Fill out that form with the details so true
Add other creators who labored with you

**[VERSE 3 - CALL]**
What about the versions, how do they grow?
Will my reference stay or will it flow?

**[VERSE 3 - RESPONSE]**
When you mint with a version, append point two
Point three, point four, each one brand new
The synapse identifier with dot ex ex shown
Ensures that same data is always known
But if you mint without that version number's call
The DOI will point to the latest of all
Living and changing, that document grows
Consistent access wherever it goes

**[VERSE 4 - CALL]**
Tell me about the sharing, who sees what I've made?
Will my private work be on display?

**[VERSE 4 - RESPONSE]**
The minting of DOI won't change your control
Your sharing settings keep their role
Private stays private in Synapse's keep
But the metadata surfaces, the title runs deep
Title and authors and publication year
CrossCite will find them, loud and clear
The metadata travels while your object rests safe
Protected and private in its rightful place

**[VERSE 5 - CALL]**
Who has the power to create and to mint?
What are the permissions, give me a hint

**[VERSE 5 - RESPONSE]**
Only those with Edit access and above
Can mint these identifiers with love
If you don't see the option in your view
You need permissions, that's what's true
Ask your administrator, make your request known
So that the minting power can be shown

**[VERSE 6 - CALL]**
Show me the format, how does it appear?
How will researchers find it near?

**[VERSE 6 - RESPONSE]**
Doi:ten point seven three zero three
Followed by the synapse identifier you see
Syn two five eight zero eight five three
A project identifier, a URL so free
Https colon slash slash doi dot org
Slash ten point seven three zero three, strong
It redirects automatic to the portal so bright
The AMP-AD Knowledge Portal in your sight

**[VERSE 7 - CALL]**
What if I need to update what I've done?
Can I change the DOI when revisions come?

**[VERSE 7 - RESPONSE]**
You can update the existing DOI with care
If the information needs repair
But know that the title and year, they say
It's not advisable to change their way
When new versions arise and the data transforms
Create a new DOI to follow the norms
Each version gets its own identifier true
Ensuring researchers get what they pursue

**[FINAL CHORUS]**
Mint it, mint it, let the object shine
Create that DOI, make it yours and mine
Projects and files, folders and views
Tables and data, spreading the news
From Synapse to the world, let the knowledge flow free
Persistent and present for all eternity
Oh, persistent and present for all we can see
Persistent and present, eternally free"

With moderator's mighty hand,
You hold the trash can icon near,
To delete what all hold dear!

Watch the unwanted words now die,
The trash can icon marks the way,
To vanish posts both night and day!

But should you stumble, should you err,
And wish the deleted to recur,

Show Deleted Threads laid bare!

Restore it from the digital gloom,
Select Restore Thread from the menu's call,
And resurrect what once did fall!

Bring important threads to shine!
Moderators, lift them high,
To the top where all may spy!

Pinned posts keep their sacred drive,
At the summit they shall stay,
Through every passing, darkening day!

Unpin them too, when time demands,
Following your guiding hands,
The power rests within your keep,
These forums moderate and deep!

*[Final key modulation, sustained high note of crystalline purity]*

**[CODA - Theatrical Finale]**

*[Strings swell, French horns crescendo, timpani thunder]*

Oh, Discussion forum bright,
Where collaboration finds its light!
Create and follow, moderate with grace,
This sacred collaborative space!

Let voices rise in harmony true,
As project members all pursue,
The sharing of ideas, thoughts, and dreams,
In forums flowing like moonlit streams!

**[VERSE 1 - Spoken Word Intensity]**
Listen up, they're locking data behind walls of silence,
But we got the tools, we got the science!
Every file's got a number, a Synapse identifier,
That's ""syn"" plus eight digits—that's the fire!
syn12345678—remember that format,
That's how we find what they tried to hide, combat the blackout!

**[PRE-CHORUS]**
They said the data's closed, but we know better!
We're breaking through together!

**[CHORUS - Soaring, Defiant]**
Download, download, take back what's ours!
Python, R, command line—we got the power!
Get command, get command—it's the way to go,
Programmatic access, watch the knowledge flow!
Download, download, spread it far and wide,
No more gatekeepers, no more lies to hide!
Every file, every folder, every truth they stored,
We're downloading revolution, that's the word!

**[VERSE 2 - Raw, Powerful]**
Before you start, understand the system:
Cache location is your home directory, listen!
Point-synapseCache—that's where files live,
MD5 checksums verify—that's how we give
Protection to the data, no re-downloading waste,
Same file twice? Synapse won't re-duplicate the haste!

Python client: import synapseclient, then login!
syn equals synapseclient.Synapse—that's how you begin!
entity equals syn.get with your Synapse identifier,
Then entity.path shows you where it went—that's the clarifier!

Multiple versions? We demand them all!
Pass the version parameter—don't let them stall!
syn.get with version equals one—download what you need,
Linked data? Use followLink equals true—plant the seed!

Override the default location, take control of your space,
downloadLocation parameter—claim your base!
Specify the path where you want files to land,
""/path/to/folder""—take a stand!

Download, download, take back what's ours!
Query the annotations, find the data towers!
Create a file view first—organize the fight,
Table query, select from—bring it to light!
Where dataType equals ""mRNA,"" fileType equals ""fastq,""
Cell-Type-of-Origin equals ""CD34+ cells""—that's the track!
Recursive downloading—maintain folder structure whole,
Synapse get with recursive flag—that's the goal!

**[VERSE 4 - Spoken, Confrontational]**
They thought they could contain us with their systems and their gates,
But we're downloading wikis, we're not accepting their fates!
Get-Wiki-Headers shows the structure of the page,
Get-Wiki with Synapse identifier and page ID—engage!

syncFromSynapse—that's the bulk download method,
Crawls all subfolders, retrieves what's been fetched, and
Creates a tab-delimited manifest of everything you claim,
Path, provenance, annotations—document the name!

Command line: synapse get—simple and direct!
R client: synGet—same respect!
Download to your working directory, override where it goes,
This is how collective resistance grows!

We're downloading the future, reclaiming youth!

R language users, login to Docker registry first
system command docker login docker synapse org, quench that thirst

Get the submission object, extract what you need
dockerRepositoryName and dockerDigest, read the feed
Combine them together with the at symbol in between
Pull that image down, the cleanest you've seen
Check if nzchar, make sure the strings are real
System call the docker pull, that's the deal
Exit code zero means success, you're good to go
If it's not a Docker submission, the message will show

Rich instrumentation blends acoustic piano, soft strings, and ambient electric guitar layering. Deep, introspective mood with melancholic yet hopeful atmosphere. Vocals sit prominently in the mix with gentle harmonies underneath. Themes explore personal growth, lost love, and finding peace within vulnerability. Production emphasizes emotional storytelling with sophisticated chord progressions and cinematic production. Perfect for quiet reflection and emotional connection—capturing that late-night contemplation feeling.","# Evaluation Queue: A Reflections at Midnight

*(Verse 1)*
Late at night, I'm thinking through the framework we have built,
A Synapse Challenge waiting, every data point distilled,
You need a project first, with edit permissions in your hand,
Enable experimental mode to see where we all stand,
Then find the Challenge tab and add that evaluation queue,
Give it a unique name so the system knows what's true.

*(Pre-Chorus)*
In the darkness, there's a structure waiting,
Parameters we're contemplating,
Description, submission instructions clear,
A receipt message when they're drawing near.

*(Chorus)*
We're building evaluation queues at midnight,
Collecting submissions in the quiet light,
Docker images and Synapse files aligned,
Open-access data, leaving doubts behind,
Setting quotas, round duration set,
This is how we organize our best.

*(Verse 2)*
You can limit submissions per participant per round,
Daily, weekly, monthly quotas can compound,
Start date and end date frame the open door,
Advanced limits stack with every plus sign more,
The submission limit holds them back once they've reached their peak,
The system won't allow one more attempt that week.

*(Pre-Chorus)*
Sharing settings matter deeply,
Administrator access kept so steeply,
Can Score downloads what they need to see,
Can Submit lets them participate so free.

*(Chorus)*
We're building evaluation queues at midnight,
Collecting submissions in the quiet light,
Docker images and Synapse files aligned,
Open-access data, leaving doubts behind,
Setting quotas, round duration set,
This is how we organize our best.

*(Bridge)*
When the quota closes, when the round duration's passed,
No submissions can come through, even admin users last,
Copies made of everything that's sent into the queue,
Even if the submitter deletes it, scorers still see through,
Sharing with your teams now, view and download rights,
Can View sees the leaderboard in these reflective nights.

*(Verse 3)*
Any Synapse entity can make its way inside,
Python, R, they've got the code that's your reliable guide,
Evaluation ID provided by the administrator's hand,
Entity identifier helps you make your stand,
Name your submission, recognize your team,
Testfile dot txt becomes your submission scheme.

*(Verse 4)*
Every submission gets a unique identifier code,
Don't confuse it with the Synapse ID mode,
Submit to Challenge from the File Tools menu found,
Follow all the steps to get your entry crowned,
Create a submission view from Tables up above,
Add Submission View to see what you love.

*(Pre-Chorus)*
Annotations indexed automatically,
Multiple evaluation queues are practically,
Embedded in that wiki page so clean,
The leaderboard's the most dynamic scene.

*(Chorus)*
We're building evaluation queues at midnight,
Collecting submissions in the quiet light,
Docker images and Synapse files aligned,
Open-access data, leaving doubts behind,
Setting quotas, round duration set,
This is how we organize our best.

*(Outro)*
Navigate the Tables tab, select and add,
Query with your statement, don't be sad,
Replace that synID with the view you made,
In the midnight hours, where all dreams are laid,
Evaluation queues at midnight, holding all we know,
In the quiet reflection, let the data flow."

*(Verse 1)*
In the hazy light of complex data streams
Floating through your project, caught between dreams
Who needs to view this space, who edits the files?
Permission layers drifting for miles and miles
Consider the questions, let them dissolve
Raw data, processed data, puzzles to solve
Internal notes whispered in folders so deep
Public methodology for the world to keep

*(Pre-Chorus)*
Teams are floating, teams are calling
Gathering users, never falling
Group them together by what they need
Plant the permission seed, plant the seed

*(Chorus)*
In Synapse teams, we're drifting through
Administrative dreams, shared with you
Some can edit, some can view
Download and discover what is true
Permissions additive, layered so deep
Building the structure while we sleep
Teams, teams, teams—the answer we seek
In this beautiful Synapse dream so unique

*(Verse 2)*
Create administrators with power to guide
Data curators working side by side
Downloaders gathering knowledge to grow
Highest permissions shimmer and glow
Remove someone gently, their access will fade
From admin to editor, permissions cascade
If you take them from one, they fall to the next
Additive layers, ethereally flexed

*(Pre-Chorus)*
Teams are floating, teams are calling
Managing access, never falling
Prevent the errors, prevent the pain
When someone leaves your collaboration chain

*(Chorus)*
In Synapse teams, we're drifting through
Administrative dreams, shared with you
Some can edit, some can view
Download and discover what is true
Permissions additive, layered so deep
Building the structure while we sleep
Teams, teams, teams—the answer we seek
In this beautiful Synapse dream so unique

*(Bridge)*
Local sharing settings, create them with care
Click Project Settings floating in air
Make it public, then navigate down
To the folder, to the town
Folder Tools, Folder Sharing Settings call
Create local sharing, restrict it all
Make it private, remove the web
Keep it sacred, keep it held
The benefactor identifier shows
Where permissions flow and grow
Parent folder, project's name
Sharing settings stake their claim

*(Verse 3)*
When local sharing blooms, a new benefactor appears
The folder becomes the source through the years
Everything inside inherits from here
Instead of the project, crystal and clear
Create a view to see them all at a glance
Benefactor ID in this permission dance
Find the folders where settings changed
Where local sharing rearranged

*(Verse 4)*
Query the data with SQL-like words
""Where benefactor ID differs,"" you've heard
Select the ID, the parent, the type
Find items where permissions are ripe
Compare benefactor to project ID there
Where they don't match, local settings care
Hundreds of rows, thousands of more
Audit your sharing to your core

*(Final Chorus)*
In Synapse teams, we're drifting through
Administrative dreams, shared with you
Some can edit, some can view
Download and discover what is true
Permissions additive, layered so deep
Building the structure while we sleep

In this beautiful Synapse dream so unique

Where the permissions flow and flow

**[Intro - Organ & Choir]**
Oh, tell me how we build it strong
Science needs a truth that lasts so long
Track every step, every single way
Provenance is here to save the day

**[Verse 1]**
Started with a vision, raw data in my hand
Generate those random numbers, follow the plan
Write your R script, save it to a file
Upload to Synapse, let me show you the style
Each step connected, nothing left behind
Origin and journey, that's what we find
Used and executed, keep it crystal clear
Input files and software, document it here

**[Chorus]**
Provenance, provenance, tell the story true
Every connection, every single move
From the data to the results we see
Building reproducibility
Used components, executed code
Following the W three C road
Track it all, don't let it fade
Reproducible work that's here to stay

**[Verse 2]**
Upload your file with the command line call
Synapse add with parent, that's not all
Specify the synID where your code resides
Used and executed, side by side
Python, R, or web client too
Multiple methods to do what you do
Store your data file in the parent space
Set provenance relationships in place

**[Bridge - Building Intensity]**
Square those numbers, take the next step
Add the data file, don't forget
Set provenance for entity new
Used the old file, executed code through
Activity object keeps track so clear
What was generated, what was here
Local variables or synID names
Every workflow, every single frame

**[Verse 3]**
Edit your provenance, navigate the file
File Tools dropdown, editing style
Pop-up window, enter what you need
Full URL path, that's guaranteed
External references, GitHub links too
Source code versioning in view
Command line: set-provenance command
Edit relationships, make them expand

**[Verse 4]**
Need to delete? You must be the one
Who created the entity, that's how it's done
Web client interface, click the minus sign
Remove each activity, one at a time
Python: deleteProvenance on your synID
R: synDeleteProvenance, don't go skid
Currently command line doesn't support this way
But other methods work every day

**[Verse 5]**
View your provenance, let it all show
Triple dots expanding, watch it grow
Get-provenance command shows the flow
Synapse dot getProvenance, let it go
Python and R, they both can see
The complete activity tree
Every component, every used file
Building scientific credibility

**[Verse 6]**
Activity objects govern all the ties
Dependencies that don't lie
Objects used in analysis steps
Generated files, keeping concepts
Reuse activities for multiple files
Synapse relationships reconcile
Data analysis, multiple stages strong
From raw files to results all along

**[Final Chorus]**
Provenance, provenance, build the truth today
Document each workflow, every single way
W three C specification guides our hand
Making reproducible science grand
Used and executed, kept so clear
Transparency for all to hear
Track it all with conviction strong
Reproducible research all along

Oh, Synapse provenance, set us free
From the origin to what we see
Every step accounted for and true
Science reproducible through and through
Yes, through and through

**[INTRO - Atmospheric, Building]**
(Ohhhhh, yeah... come on now...)
(Tell me 'bout the way... the way we share...)

**[VERSE 1]**
There's a platform built on trust, Synapse is the name,
Different user types, different rights in the game,
Four account types, let me break it down clear,
Anonymous browsing, that's where we start here,
You can view the public catalog, see the files and the data too,
But the controlled information, that ain't shown to you,
Can't create no projects, can't upload, can't download,
Can't add wiki content, can't join the discussion crowd,
But you can review the features, see what Synapse provides,
It's the gateway to knowledge, the open-minded guide!

**[CHORUS]**
(Call and Response)
Lead: Account types! They guide us!
Response: Guide us to the right way!
Lead: Registered users! Step it up now!
Response: Step it up to a higher day!
Lead: Create projects, build your teams!
Response: Collaborate on your dreams!
Lead: Download public data, fulfill the conditions true,
Response: Access controlled data, when the Conditions for Use come through!

**[VERSE 2]**
Now when you register, you join the community,
You create your projects, establish unity,
Collaborate with others, form Synapse teams,
Download public information, fulfill your dreams,
But if you want the controlled access tier,
You gotta meet the Conditions for Use, that's clear,
Each project's got requirements you must satisfy,
Before that controlled data reaches your eye,
It's about responsibility, respect, and care,
For the data donors who shared their prayer!

**[CHORUS - Building Energy]**
Lead: Certified users! Take the quiz now!
Response: Fifteen questions, twenty minutes, wow!
Lead: Learn the Commons Data Use Procedure!
Response: Understand the rules, become a believer!
Lead: Upload your files, create your folders too!
Response: Full functionality waiting there for you!
Lead: Add the provenance, upload containers strong!
Response: You earned this power, you belonged all along!

**[VERSE 3]**
But there's one more level, hear me now,
Validated users, let me show you how,
You gotta establish your identity, that's the key,
Complete your profile with your information free,
Your full name, affiliation, city, country too,
Make your profile public, let the world see you,
Link your researcher ID profile to your name,
Sign the Synapse Pledge, join this noble aim,
Submit identity attestation, current within the month,
A letter from an official on letterhead—that's the crux,
Or a notarized letter, or a professional license,
Not a work badge though, that ain't sufficient!

**[BRIDGE - Passionate Crescendo]**
(Yeah! Oh yes! Tell me more!)
When you're validated, oh, the doors open wide,
Access to mHealth data, nothing left to hide,
Bridge data requires this validation, it's true,
The Governance team confirms the best of you,
You'll get a notification email, celebration time,
A badge on your profile, a testament divine,
That you understand the responsibility we share,
Data donor reciprocity, showing that we care!

**[VERSE 4 - Powerful Delivery]**
Now let me tell you 'bout the privileges clear,
Anonymous can browse, but they can't pioneer,
Registered users download public files and more,
Certified users got the upload door,
Validated users request the restricted tier,
But understand—your download ability here
Depends on your account type, the sharing settings too,
And fulfilling Conditions for Use that's on you,
Each file, each table, got requirements specific,
You gotta read them careful, make it explicit!

**[VERSE 5 - Teaching Truth]**
Group memberships track who you are today,
Anonymous users ain't in no group, that's the way,
But when you register and log into Synapse strong,
You join the ""Registered Synapse Users"" throng,
Pass that certification quiz, automatic you rise,
Straight to the Certified group, before your eyes,
And when the Governance team validates your claim,
They add you to that group, seal your name!

**[VERSE 6 - Responsibility Theme]**
But hear this truth, no matter what your status be,
You responsible for your actions, that's the key,
You must abide by Terms and Conditions true,
Follow all the policies that guide what you do,
The Synapse Governance principles are your light,
Study them careful, get them right,
If you got questions, reach out with care,
Contact the Access and Compliance Team there,
Act at Synapse dot org, that's the email address,
They'll help you navigate this governance process!

**[FINAL CHORUS - Triumphant, Full Energy]**
Lead: Account types! They protect us!
Response: Protect the data and the trust!
Lead: Anonymous, Registered, Certified, Validated too!
Response: Each one serving what we're called to do!
Lead: Understand the privileges you've earned!
Response: Study the rules, let wisdom be learned!
Lead: Responsible sharing, transparent and clear!
Response: Building community, year after year!
Lead: Synapse governance! It's the way!
