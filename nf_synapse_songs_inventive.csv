**""Ethereal Void Screamo""** – Deathcore with haunting angelic falsetto layers weaving through guttural pig squeals and pitched vocal harmonies. Mid-tempo (110 BPM) with sudden tempo shifts. Vocals feature dual-tracked clean ethereal singing layered beneath demonic growls, creating an unsettling angel-vs-demon dialogue. Instrumentation blends djembe tribal percussion with drop-tuned 8-string guitars, orchestral string swells, and lo-fi vinyl crackle underneath. Heavy breakdown sections feature vocoder-processed screams creating robotic, otherworldly textures. Mood: apocalyptic yet transcendent, exploring themes of inner conflict, spiritual duality, and cosmic horror. Production emphasizes contrast—crystalline chorus vocals against distorted verse aggression. Subtle synth pads create cathedral ambience during climactic screamed passages. Raw, experimental, boundary-pushing deathcore fusion.","# ETHEREAL VOID SCREAMO: THE NEUROFIBROMATOSIS DATA PORTAL

A haunting fusion of raw emo vulnerability and deep blues melancholy, featuring a lead vocalist whose voice is fragmented through analog tape-loop effects and pitched down an octave in the chorus. Tempo shifts between 85 BPM verses (heavy, dragging blues shuffle) and frantic 140 BPM pre-choruses with glitchy vocal stutters. Instrumentation: weathered acoustic guitar layered with synthetic string drones, vintage Moog bass, and hand-played tape loops creating rhythmic stutters. The vocal delivery alternates between breathy, almost-whispered confessions and anguished wails processed through vocoder and reverse-reverb. Sparse hand-claps and found-sound percussion (creaking doors, cracking ice) punctuate sparse arrangements. Mood: cathartic darkness with experimental edge—like heartbreak filtered through damaged equipment. Lyrical themes explore emotional dissolution, digital disconnection, and fractured memories. Peak moments feat...","# DATA DISSOLUTION (A Glitchy Emo-Blues Lament)

**[VERSE 1 - 85 BPM, breathy whisper over weathered acoustic guitar and tape loops]**
I'm selecting my license, but my hands are shaking
CC Zero, no rights reserved, it's breaking
Raw experimental data, nothing analyzed
Just the output of my experiment, unfiltered, undesguised
Creative Commons calls it ""no rights reserved""
Public domain bleeding, every word
I'm depositing my data like I'm burying my soul
Into the portal, losing all control

**[PRE-CHORUS - 140 BPM, glitchy vocal stutters, synthetic strings ascending]**
But wait—wait—wait, I gotta check my authority
Wait—wait—wait, is this irrevocable?
Before I release it—lease it—lease it
Make sure I have the right, the right, the right to do this

**[CHORUS - Pitched down an octave, vocoder-processed, vintage Moog bass heavy]**
CC Zero, CC Zero, sinking down so low
No restrictions on my data, watch it grow, grow, grow
Public domain, public domain, it's the standard they all know
Enables reuse, advances new discoveries, even though—
Even though it's gone, it's gone, it's gone
My raw data lives forever but I'm gone, gone, gone

**[VERSE 2 - 85 BPM, anguished wail, hand-claps punctuate]**
Copyright law is tangled, complex as my grief
Any restriction deters the reuse, brings no relief
Funding requirements mandate this release
Publicly funded projects need this peace
The NF Data Portal demands it all
Reanalysis, repurposing, answering the call
But human data—that's a different pain
Sensitive and governed by HIPAA's chain

**[PRE-CHORUS - 140 BPM, tape-loop stutters intensify, creaking-door sounds]**
If I'm sharing human data—data—data
I must follow regulations, every nation's law
I need informed consent—sent—sent

**[CHORUS - Pitched down, reverse-reverb vocal wail]**
CC Zero for the non-human, non-human, non-human
But human data needs protection, protection, protection
Notify Sage Bionetworks, quality concerns addressed
De-identify everything, pass the ethics test
Submit corrections quickly, quickly, quickly
Consult your review board, consult them strictly
Respect the consent requirements, requirements, requirements
Human data demands all the legal agreements

**[VERSE 3 - 85 BPM, almost-whispered confession over cracking-ice percussion]**
Confirm with your review board that consent was given
De-identify all records, keep the patients living
Don't disclose identifiers to the portal or the networks
Protect the sensitive information—that's what your duty's worth
Submit quality corrections as quickly as you're able
Notify them of concerns, keep it on the table
Consult legal counsel if you question sharing rights
Intellectual property protection through the night

**[BRIDGE - Frantic 140 BPM, all elements layered chaotically]**
The default is CC Zero, Zero, Zero
For non-human experimental data, hero, hero, hero
But before you click that button, understand the cost
Once it's irrevocable, the rights are lost
Make sure you have authority to release
Make sure it's truly yours before you cease
Control of your creation, your discovery
It's a permanent decision—can't recover

**[FINAL CHORUS - Distorted, layered vocal loops, everything maxed]**
CC Zero, CC Zero, sinking down so low

But human data needs protection every day

I'm releasing my data into the public domain
Raw experimental output flowing like rain

Glitchy psychedelic bubblegum pop with fragmented vocal layering and granular synthesis. Lead vocalist sings bright, youthful melodies with stuttering vocal chops, reversed phonetic fragments, and pitched vocal glitches that phase in and out. 120-85 BPM tempo shifts with sudden drops into lo-fi lofi territories. Instrumentation: theremin drones, detuned lo-fi drums, wet synth pads, occasional distorted ukulele stabs, and breathy vocoder effects. Vocals float between sweet childlike whispers and glitchy robotic processing—creating unsettling-yet-catchy contrast. Mood: candy-coated nightmare, nostalgic future-shock. Lyrically: themes of digital consciousness, lost memories, and surreal dreamscapes painted in bubblegum sweetness. Reverb-drenched harmonies clash with crisp vocal chops.

**Hypnotic vocal-sampling meets nostalgic 80s synth-pop ballad with experimental glitch textures.** Angelic, reverb-drenched alto singing layered with pitched-down vocal loops and stuttering digital artifacts. Tempo drifts between 72-95 BPM with rubber-band pitch warping. Lush analog synth pads collide with corrupted VHS crackle, filtered electric piano, and ethereal vocoder harmonies. Melancholic, dreamlike atmosphere blending mall-elevator aesthetics with dystopian underwater melancholy. Lyrics explore faded memories, lost consumer culture, and digital transcendence—sung through gauzy vocal distortion, reversed vocal sections, and ethereal whispered ad-libs floating beneath the mix.

The lead vocalist delivers soulful, melismatic phrases with vocal distortion and granular processing, creating an otherworldly texture between earthly spirituality and cosmic transcendence. Tempo: 76 BPM with occasional rhythmic glitches. Instrumentation fuses traditional pipe organ with ambient pad synths, analog tape wobble, and stuttering 808s underneath crisp gospel clapping. The vocals employ unexpected octave jumps, reversed harmony sections, and processed breathy whispers between verses. Mood: transcendent and mysterious—evoking spiritual awakening through a psychedelic lens. Lyrically: meditative themes of inner redemption, divine connection, and transformation.

Soaring soprano vocals layered with guttural death growls, trading verses over crushing distorted guitars mixed with orchestral strings and eerie theremin swells. Tempo shifts dramatically: explosive 180 BPM metal breakdowns interrupted by ethereal 60 BPM operatic passages with haunting choir arrangements. Vocals processed through vintage tape saturation, reverse reverb, and pitch-shifting creating an otherworldly collision between Wagnerian drama and headbanging fury. Sparse piano punctuates brutal guitar riffs; chaotic strings screech alongside heavy tom fills. Mood: haunting, visceral, transcendent chaos. Lyrically explores inner darkness meeting divine beauty, existential screams wrapped in melodic elegance. Avant-garde production: vocal doubles panned wildly, sudden silence drops, distorted harmonies creating dissonant beauty.

A haunting fusion of traditional bluegrass vocals layered with glitchy digital artifacts and voice-shredding effects. Acoustic banjo and fiddle interweave with stuttering synthesizers and pitch-shifted vocal loops that fragment and reassemble mid-phrase.

Tempo shifts between 90-140 BPM, creating tension between organic folk instrumentation and harsh digital interference. Deep reverb washes blend hand-clapped percussion with corrupted lo-fi tape loops. The atmosphere is eerie yet intimate—like traditional Appalachian storytelling colliding with digital decay. Lyrics explore themes of memory erosion, rural alienation, and the clash between analog heritage and digital futures.

Moody synthwave with hypnotic 80s-inspired synth basslines and pulsing neon arpeggios. Vocals delivered as sultry, noir-detective storytelling with granular time-stretching effects and digital stuttering on key phrases. Layer breathy, almost whispered verses against soaring, reverb-drenched choruses with pitched vocal harmonies that glitch and fragment mid-phrase. Tempo: 92 BPM with occasional tempo warps (89-95 BPM shifts). Unexpected twist: vinyl crackle and tape saturation underneath crystalline synth pads; add sporadic vocoder-effected harmonies that sound like they're transmitting through a failing radio. Instrumentation: analog 80s synths, lo-fi drum machines with vinyl distortion, atmospheric string pad swells, and pitched vocal chops as percussion. Dark, cinematic atmosphere with themes of urban solitude, faded memories, and digital melancholy. Vocals should feel like a lonely midnight broadcast from a neon-soaked city.","# NEON LEXICON BLUES

Ethereal gospel vocals layered with crisp digital stuttering and granular synthesis, creating a collision between sacred spirituality and futuristic electronica. Lead vocalist delivers soaring, reverb-drenched melismatic runs over shuffling trap-influenced hi-hats (120-90 BPM dynamic shifts) and warm analog Rhodes piano filtered through glitchy bit-crushing. Unexpected sonic twists: vocal harmonies harmonically inverted and time-stretched into alien textures, occasional pitched vocal percussion mimicking robotic choir members, and ambient pad swells reminiscent of choir reverb in a cathedral made of data. Raw emotional delivery meets avant-garde production—think Lauryn Hill meets Autechre. Themes explore redemption through technology, spiritual transcendence in the digital age, and finding grace amid fragmentation. Atmospheric: ethereal yet broken, hopeful yet unsettling, deeply human yet digitally transformed.","# SYNAPSE SALVATION

**Fractured Ethereal Avant-Garde with Vocal Granulation**

Haunting, falsetto-driven vocals processed through extreme time-stretching and granular synthesis, creating ghostly, stuttering harmonies that phase in and out of reality. Tempo shifts unpredictably (73-120 BPM) with glitchy electronic breakdowns. Layer detuned operatic wails over industrial metallic percussion, processed typewriter clicks, and reversed string drones. Vocalist uses extreme register jumps, vocal fry, and whispered passages mixed with angelic sustains. Synths bubble and decay like corrupted digital water. Lyrics explore fractured consciousness and memory loss through abstract, repetitive syllable patterns. Sparse, disorienting arrangement with sudden drops into silence. Mood: unsettling yet beautiful—like wandering through an abandoned cathedral made of sound.","# PROJECTLIVE FRACTURED ETHEREAL

A haunting alt-country ballad where the lead vocal is whisper-sung through a vintage telephone filter, layered beneath its own reversed echo that plays like a ghostly duet. Tempo shifts from slowburn (60 BPM) to frantic (140 BPM) during the chorus. Instrumentation: detuned acoustic guitar with fingernail picking, tremolo-heavy electric bass, subtle orchestral strings processed through lo-fi tape saturation, and distant train whistle samples. The vocal performance features intentional vocal cracks, melodic spoken-word verses, and harmonic layers that sound like multiple versions of the singer from different timelines. Production: heavy use of reverb-drenched vocals, vinyl crackle, and panned harmonies that drift across stereo field. Mood: cinematic melancholy with noir detective story atmosphere. Lyrical themes: lost love on dusty highways, forgotten small towns, and searching for redemption in whiskey-soaked nights. A raw, expe...","# METADATA NOIR: A WHISPERED RECKONING

There's standardized information, yeah, it's been here all along,
Metadata, metadata—that's the story 'bout the story told,
It's data about the data, friend, worth more than digital gold.

*(Pre-Chorus - Tempo shift begins, 60 BPM)*
The contributors came through town with their manifest in hand,
A summary CSV file listing every file they planned,
Properties characterizing each one—assay, species, individual ID,
The sample links are written there for all the world to see.

For analysis and searching—oh, it makes the research complete,
Every property that's present depends on what you're after, friend,
Context for reusability from beginning until the end.

*(Bridge - Tempo drops back to 60 BPM, harmonic layers)*
You gotta know what properties exist before you go too far,
You gotta understand what metadata terms really are,
When you're searching through that portal, got to filter and refine,
Two tumor terms look similar—but they ain't the same design.

Annotations match the manifest, they're dancing in the same old way,
Pre-compiled and ready there for researchers every day,
In the Synapse web UI where the filtered data waits,
Understanding what's available—that's what makes you great.

Manifest, manifest, tell me what you know,
Annotations in the system make the dataset glow,
The metadata dictionary helps you find your way back home,
Through the clinical data files and tables carved in stone,
Individual-level patient demographics, phenotypes so deep,
CSV files and Synapse tables where the secrets sleep.

*(Outro - Tempo slows to 40 BPM, train whistle fades)*
More restrictions on the clinical data, harder shares to find,
But it's there if it's available, in the contributor's mind,

A darkly seductive tango vocal experience at 95 BPM with syncopated rhythm breaks. Deep, smoky baritone vocals layered with granular vocal scratching and modulated whispers that glitch and stutter. Live bandoneon weaves through lo-fi broken beats, analog tape saturation, and reversed vocal reverb tails. The singer performs dramatic Spanish lyrics about urban decay and faded love, with sudden tempo shifts (76→110 BPM) and unexpected trap snares puncturing the orchestral melancholy. Atmospheric strings dissolve into robotic vocal harmonies; intimate verses contrast with distorted, falsetto-heavy choruses.

If PI changes institutions during active award
Same Synapse project continues—this is the accord
Sage updates PI contact information and adds new institution
Members from new institution may need addition

If new ProposalCentral grant link is created
Associated with existing project—the data narrated

**""Crystalline Soul with Chromatic Glitch-Singing""**

Deep, rich soul vocals layered with subtle digital glitching and pitch-shifting that fragmentizes words mid-phrase, creating an ethereal ""fractured consciousness"" effect. Tempo: 92 BPM with rhythmic stutters and temporal warps. Instrumentation: warm analog strings mixed with granular synthesizers, live upright bass, and handclaps underneath pulsing Rhodes piano. Vocal style: breathy, intimate verses with unexpected falsetto runs treated through lo-fi degradation, building to soaring, soul-drenched choruses with reversed vocal harmonies. Production: vinyl crackle underbed, mysterious atmospheric pads that shimmer and fade. Mood: introspective yet otherworldly—like soul music transmitted from another dimension. Lyrical themes: existential love, fragmented memories, searching for human connection in a digital world. Raw emotional power meets avant-garde experimentation.","# ""Portal of Fragments""

**[VERSE 1 - Breathy, intimate]**
(Vocal glitch: ""Navi-navi-navigating..."")
Welcome to the structure, let me break it down slow,
Funding organizations, they're the seeds that help us grow,
Children's Tumor Foundation, Neurofibromatosis Therapeutic Acceleration Program,
Gilbert Family Foundation—they're the architects of our grand plan,
(Falsetto run with lo-fi degradation)
Initiatives bundle grants together, see how they align,
Multiple projects flowing like a crystalline design...

**[PRE-CHORUS - Building intensity]**
(Stuttering effect: ""Terms, terms, terms define..."")
Every layer, every tier, helps us organize,
Different contexts might redefine, but here's the portal's prize,

**[CHORUS - Soaring, soul-drenched]**
We're searching for connection in this data stream,
Fragmented but complete, a digital dream,
Studies hold the stories—titles, summaries, investigators,
Access requirements, acknowledgements, data aggregators,
Raw sequencing files and processed files too,
Datasets bundled together, harmonized for you,
(Vinyl crackle underbed, atmospheric pads shimmer)
In this portal, in this portal, we remember...

**[VERSE 2 - Contemplative, with chromatic shifts]**
(Pitch-shifting mid-phrase: ""Data files, they vary..."")
Thousands of files living in this space,
Individual runs, FASTQ sequences, funder reports we trace,
Datasets—sometimes hundreds bundled in one,
Sometimes just a few, but the work gets done,

Publications collected by our curation team,
Stories born from funded research dreams,
If your work exists but isn't showing here,
Reach out to nf-osi at sagebionetworks, make it clear...

Biological and computational tools we've designed,
To explore, to analyze, neurofibromatosis data combined,
Some run on our datasets, some use DrugBank's vast store,
Submit your tools to nf-osi, we welcome more and more,
(Granular synthesizers wash over)
Email nf-osi at sagebionetworks for your contribution's sake,
In this fragmented network, we're all awake...

**[FINAL CHORUS - Maximum soul with reversed harmonies]**
We're searching for connection in this data stream,
Hackathons and initiatives, collaborative dreams,
Studies bundle everything—lead investigators guide the way,
Tools and publications showing us the path each day,
Access requirements, metadata files aligned,
Related studies linking consciousness through time,
(Handclaps, upright bass pulse, Rhodes piano swell)
In this portal, in this portal, we find our way,
In this portal, in this portal, we stay...

Navigate the structure, learn the terms by heart,
Every file, every dataset is a work of art,
We're transmitting soul through this digital dimension,
Fragmented but whole—that's our intention...

https://help.nf.synapse.org/NFdocs/resource-hub,"**Enka-Glitch Noir Ballad**

A haunting fusion of traditional Japanese Enka with digital decay and noir atmospherics. Deep, quivering vocals with manual pitch-bending and tremolo effects layered over melancholic string arrangements. Tempo fluctuates between 60-90 BPM with intentional digital glitches, vinyl crackle, and reversed vocal fragments. The singer's voice is raw and emotional—think Ishikawa Sayuri meeting experimental electronic—with orchestral weeping strings contrasted by stuttering synth pulses and lo-fi tape saturation. Minor key throughout with unexpected modulations. Sparse upright bass, rain-like granular synthesis, and vintage tape wobble create an eerie, nostalgic-futuristic blend. Lyrics explore urban loneliness, lost love, and temporal disorientation. The production deliberately breaks down mid-song into abstract vocal processing before rebuilding into lush, almost unbearably sad crescendos. Atmospheric, cinematic, utterly unconventional yet deeply soulful.","# SYNAPSE NOCTURNE: A GLITCH-ENKA REQUIEM

A haunting blend of contemporary R&B vocals layered with digital distortion and vinyl crackle. Lead vocals feature a raw, defiant alto with breathy whisper-sung harmonies that phase in and out of reality. Tempo: 92 BPM with unpredictable beat stutters and syncopated rhythmic breaks that jolt the listener. Instrumentation: analog strings processed through granular synthesis, lo-fi drums colliding with sharp 808s, reversed vocal chops as percussive elements, and a melancholic cello underneath. Thick, weighted bass pulses hypnotically while pitched vocal loops create an unsettling electronic choir. Production employs intentional audio compression artifacts and bit-crushing on select verses. Mood: urgent yet intimate—simultaneously fragile and powerful. Lyrics address systemic injustice with poetic metaphors, blending personal heartbreak with collective rage.

They built it lean, they built it mean
MySQL Full Text Search, the machine
Computationally efficient, economically clean
But listen close, there's a system between
Check your spelling first, that's the key
Pluralization breaks the symmetry
Suffixes like -ing, they don't set you free
Search ""plexiform neurofibroma,"" singular, see?

*(Pre-Chorus - Building distortion)*
Don't make mistakes, don't make mistakes
The search won't understand what breaks
Your query down, your query down

Four characters or less, they get erased
Short terms inside a word, displaced
Exact match, exact match, that's the way

Four characters or less, they disappear
Unless they're standalone, crystal clear
""NF1"" will hit, but ""grow"" inside ""growing"" won't appear
Exact match protocol, make it clear

Avoid the suffixes, strip them bare
Don't pluralize—precision's rare
""Neurofibromas"" fails, but singular thrives
""Neurofibroma"" keeps the search alive
Precise terminology, that's your friend
Match your criteria from start to end
No stemming roots, no branching out
Exact terms only, there's no doubt

A genre-defiant vocal odyssey blending Contemporary Christian worship with raw punk rebellion and digital experimentalism. Raspy, fervent singing collides with processed vocal layers—doubled, pitch-shifted, and fragmented into stutter-step loops. Tempo oscillates between explosive 160 BPM punk thrashing and intimate 80 BPM downtempo passages. 

Instrumentation: distorted electric guitar riffs meet orchestral strings (deliberately out-of-tune for dissonance), analog synth bass, live drums layered with digital glitch percussion, and vintage organ swells interrupted by digital artifacts.

Vocal treatment: raw, unpolished screams merge with angelic harmonies; unexpected vocal chops, robotic vocoders, and reverb-drenched whisper-singing create constant tension. Lyrics explore faith wrestled through chaos—spiritual rebellion, divine doubt, redemption through chaos. Mood swings from anthemic catharsis to unsettling vulnerability.
