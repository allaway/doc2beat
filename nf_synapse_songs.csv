Upbeat, whimsical tempo (120 BPM) featuring ornate harpsichord and lute melodies layered beneath bright, operatic vocals with playful vocal runs and harmonies. The singer delivers witty, introspective lyrics with theatrical flair and melodic embellishment—think whimsical storytelling meets classical sensibility. Orchestral strings (violins, cellos) dance around indie-pop sensibilities while maintaining harpsichord-driven bass lines. The mood is romantically nostalgic yet contemporary—a sophisticated blend of 18th-century elegance with modern vulnerability. Themes explore love's contradictions, artistic yearning, and finding beauty in melancholy moments. Vocals are precise, expressive, and showcase dynamic range with occasional vocal layering creating choir-like textures. Instrumentation balances period authenticity with indie production warmth, creating an enchanting, introspective atmosphere perfect for late-night reflection or wistful daydreaming.","# The NF Data Portal Waltz

*(Verse 1)*
Oh, gather 'round the harpsichord, I'll tell you of a place,
Where neurofibromatosis data finds its grace,
Type one and type two schwannomatosis too,
The Neurofibromatosis Open Science Initiative's breakthrough!
Since twenty-fourteen, the Children's Tumor Foundation,
The Therapeutic Acceleration Program—collaboration,
Gilbert Family, Helmsley Trust, and Sage Bionetworks' hand,
Building precious repositories across the land!

*(Pre-Chorus)*
Rare diseases need a treasure trove,
Where samples, data, research move,
Open science principles we love,
Sharing maximizes all thereof!

*(Chorus)*
The NF Data Portal, oh what a sight!
Synapse underneath, the back-end's right,
Front-facing interface, searchable and free,
Data curation, analysis, discovery!
From generation through dissemination's call,
The lifecycle dances, embracing all,
Upload to Synapse, then portal display,
The neurofibromatosis research way!

*(Verse 2)*
The data lifecycle, let me illuminate,
Generation phase—where uploads permeate,
Metadata exposed, though downloads wait,
Study descriptions help you navigate!
Then curation happens, behind the scenes,
Synapse enables what it means,
To surface data through analysis and tools,
Computational models, biological jewels!

*(Verse 3)*
Cell lines and mouse models, plasmids too,
Bundled into datasets, fresh and new,
Wikis and discussion forums shine,
Interpretation happens over time,
Publications, journals, dissemination wide,
The neurofibromatosis research tide!

*(Bridge)*
Data standards underpin the way,
Metadata schemas guide the day,
Ontologies, controlled vocabulary's art,
National Cancer Institute gave us the start!

Imaging assays for research needs,
Library preparation, read length defined,
Platform information, carefully aligned!

*(Verse 4)*
Investigators fill the manifests with care,
Using the NF Data Curator's lair,
Filename, format, resource type so clear,
Data type, subtype—precision here!
Assay platform, libraryPrep defined,
ReadLength, readPairOrientation in mind,
ReadStrandOrigin, metadata's song,
Controlled vocabularies keep it strong!

*(Verse 5)*
Instead of ""ribonucleic acid sequencing"" long,
We say ""RNA-seq""—the standardized song,
The open-source GitHub repository holds,
The data dictionary's precious folds,
Anyone in the NF research sphere,
Can join the Open Science Initiative here!

*(Final Chorus)*
The NF Data Portal, where rarities live,
Where collaboration and courage give,

Grand operatic vocal style with powerful, soaring soprano vocals delivering dramatic emotional storytelling. Tempo: 76 BPM, stately and majestic. Rich orchestration featuring strings, brass, and piano with classical arrangements. Lush, reverb-heavy production creating cathedral-like acoustics. Mood: epic, tragic, intensely passionate. Vocals: classically trained, vibrato-rich, hitting high notes with crystalline clarity and emotional vulnerability. Instrumentation: full orchestra with prominent violin sections and dramatic brass stabs. Lyrical themes: forbidden love, fate, sacrifice, human suffering, and transcendent beauty. The voice soars above sweeping melodies with theatrical delivery and profound emotional depth.","# THE GENOMIC SEQUENCE: AN OPERATIC REVELATION

**[OVERTURE - Orchestral Introduction]**

*Soaring strings and dramatic brass establish the grand theme*

**[ACT I - THE CALLING]**

*Soprano enters with crystalline, vibrato-rich vocals*

Oh, hear the cry of the helix divine!
Where coding regions and non-coding regions entwine,
A sacred journey through the genome's domain,
Where genetic variations whisper their refrain!

*Powerful crescendo*

We focus on the exons, the coding regions true,
In Whole Exome Sequencing, we know what to do—
Sequence only the exons where the genes express their might,
To identify the variations that cause disease or light!

**[VERSE I - THE COMPLETE VISION]**

*Soaring melody with emotional depth*

But some must venture further, into the vast unknown,
Where Whole Genome Sequencing claims its throne,
Both coding and non-coding regions we shall see,
The entire genetic tapestry, wild and free!

*Dramatic pause with reverb-heavy production*

Every variation throughout the genome's expanse,
Associated with disease and trait and chance,
Oh, what transcendent beauty in this complete design,
Where every base pair sings in perfect line!

**[ACT II - THE CELLULAR SYMPHONY]**

*Violin sections swell with theatrical delivery*

Then comes the Bulk RNA Sequencing call,
The transcriptome of populations, answering all,
Gene expression levels revealed in their glory,
Each sample's profile telling its story!

*Powerful brass stabs punctuate the narrative*

Compare the profiles between conditions diverse,
Between different samples, for better or worse,
The bulk populations show us the way,
How genes express themselves, day after day!

*Transition with lush orchestration*

But wait! There's another path, more intimate and rare,
Single Cell RNA Sequencing beyond compare,
We sequence each individual cell's transcriptome song,
Where gene expression levels to each cell belong!

*Soaring high notes with crystalline clarity*

Study the heterogeneity, identify the rare,
The populations hidden that others don't dare,
Each cell's unique expression, a voice in the choir,
Fulfilling our scientific desire!

**[ACT III - THE WORKFLOW REVELATION]**

*Grand orchestral swell with cathedral-like acoustics*

Oh, hear the sacred table of assays and their fates,
Where workflows open and close their gates!

*Dramatic recitative*

For Whole Exome Sequencing, these workflows are true:
Germline single nucleotide variants—available to you!
Somatic single nucleotide variants—yes, they flow!
Copy number variations—beware, for we must know:

*Powerful, passionate delivery*

The workflow exists but the National Facility for Open Science Infrastructure shall not provide this processing here,
The scientists and engineers have made it clear—
Problems in interpretation during downstream analysis arise,
So we must exercise caution, open our eyes!

*Structural variants and microsatellite instability—not applicable, they say,
Raw counts—not applicable, not this way!

*Transition with sweeping strings*

For Whole Genome Sequencing, the pathways expand,
Germline variants, somatic variants—all at hand!
Copy number variations, structural variants true,
Microsatellite instability—all available to you!

*Crystalline high notes*

Raw counts—not applicable, this we understand,
The workflow does not serve this demand!

**[ACT IV - THE TRANSCRIPTOMIC TRUTH]**

*Melancholic yet powerful soprano*

But Bulk RNA Sequencing—oh, tragic and profound,
Not applicable, not applicable all around!
Germline variants, somatic variants—not here,
Copy number variations disappear!

*Emotional vulnerability in the voice*

Structural variants, microsatellite instability—not applicable, I cry,
Only raw counts remain beneath the sky!
Raw counts available—yes, this is true,
The gene expression data, waiting for you!

*Building intensity*

Single Cell RNA Sequencing—the rarest of all,
Not applicable to most of the call!
Germline and somatic variants fade away,
Copy number variations—not here to stay!

*Dramatic brass punctuation*

Structural variants and microsatellite instability—not applicable, I sing,
But raw counts—yes, they ring!
Single cell raw counts available and clear,
The individual cell expression, drawing near!

**[FINALE - TRANSCENDENT BEAUTY]**

*Full orchestra with soaring soprano reaching the highest notes*

So choose your datatype with wisdom and care,
Whole Exome, Whole Genome, or transcriptomic air,
Bulk populations or individual cells so bright,
Each workflow a pathway to scientific light!

*Vibrato-rich, emotionally vulnerable conclusion*

The coding regions and non-coding regions entwine,
In genetic variations, transcriptomic design,
From exon to genome, from bulk to each cell,
This operatic sequence has much to tell!

*Final, crystalline high note held with reverb-heavy cathedral acoustics*

Oh, the sacred journey of sequencing divine,
Where science and fate in perfection align...

*Orchestral resolution with strings, brass, and piano in majes..."

**[Verse 1]**
Listen, got to annotate before you stage your files,
Every data set needs structure, gonna take a little while,
File format matters—fastq, bam, or cram,
But if it's bam or cram, keep it raw, that's the plan,
No filtering, no trimming, unmapped reads stay true,
That's the foundation, baby, that's what you gotta do.

**[Chorus]**
Annotate it, annotate it, build it right from the start,
Individual ID, specimen ID, that's the heart,
Annotate it, annotate it, every step matters so,
Library prep, platform, species—let the knowledge flow.

**[Verse 2]**
Choose your assay—Bulk RNA or Single Cell deep,
Whole Genome, Whole Exome—promises to keep,
Species identification, genome's gotta match,
Library prep method like KAPA Hyper PCR catch,
Platform declaration—illumina's the name,
Read pair orientation—forward, reverse, claim your frame.

**[Bridge]**
Specimen preparation, minimize degradation,
Flash freeze or RNALater—that's the preservation station,
Never use FFPE, that's the warning we sing,
Protect your RNA, let it soar on its wing.
Tumor type or normal—if it's normal, say ""not applicable"" clear,
Otherwise specify, keep the science sincere.

**[Verse 3]**
Read pair number—one or two, specify the way,
Is it stranded? Yes or no? Make that declaration today,
Read pair orientation, forward or reverse side,
Optional but recommended, let these details guide.
For Whole Exome, hear this crucial refrain—
BED file required or your processing won't gain.

**[Verse 4]**
Tumor-normal pairs, listen to this truth,
Without them together, somatic variants lose their proof,
Microsatellite instability processing won't proceed,
Tumor-normal pairing is the fundamental seed,
BED file associated with your library prep method,
Upload it to the team—that's how success is threaded.

**[Final Chorus]**
Annotate it, annotate it, build your dataset strong,
Every term, every detail, that's where you belong,
Annotate it, annotate it, staging's on the way,
When your annotations shine, processing saves the day.

**[Outro]**
Individual, specimen, assay, species true,
Library prep, platform, read pairs in view,
Preparation method, tumor type, stranded and orientation,
Complete annotation is your transformation."

**[Verse 1]**
Raw data, like memories I hold so tight,
From a single sample, unprocessed light,
Fastq files whisper what we used to know,
Unaligned reads in formats that glow,
You're the information before it's analyzed,
The pure, untouched truth I've memorized,
Partially processed, you remain so true,
Raw or semi-processed, I still choose you

**[Chorus]**
Choose your format carefully, mon amour,
It will echo through the future, forever more,
Others will use what we leave behind,
The data we share, the knowledge combined,
Raw data is precious, results fade away,
But the raw information will always stay,
Reproducibility, reusability,
This is our gift, this is our legacy

**[Verse 2]**
Whole genome sequencing, you're required, so dear,
Fastq or aligned BAM files I hold near,
Exome sequencing in the same sacred way,
Cram format or BAM, night after day,
SNP microarray needs both raw and processed too,
CEL and IDAT files, I'm devoted to you,
Genotypes per SNP in tsv so refined,
Two formats together, forever entwined

Immunosequencing vendor-dependent, unique and strange,
Ten X Genomics or ImmunoSEQ through change,
RNA expression, bulk sequencing required,
Raw and processed both, forever desired,
Counts matrices, quantification files so bright,
Salmon-based workflows, guiding the light,
Single-cell and single-nucleus need both kinds,
Hdf5 format, where cellxgene finds

**[Verse 3]**
From bcl files create fastq with cellranger mkfastq,
Deconvolution information, the technical facts,
Processed expression matrices in TSV so clean,
The most complete data we've ever seen,
Gene expression microarray, raw and processed state,
Normalized values at your fate,
Purity and ploidy measurements clear,
Methylation ATAC, we hold you dear

**[Verse 4]**
Bisulfite sequencing in formats we know,
Unaligned BAM or aligned, the data will flow,
LC-MS protein, you need both forms,
Raw mzML and intensities through all storms,
Metabolomics LC-MS, vendor-dependent raw,
Metabolite intensities without a flaw,
Western blots optional, densitometry shown,
Processed data only, on its own

**[Chorus 2]**
Key data is data of sufficient size,
Complex enough for future eyes,
Can be combined with similar kind,
Mined for knowledge we haven't find,
High-throughput methods, more than one or two,
Widely used systematic format true,
Validation data for methods new,
Or unique, non-recreatable through and through

**[Verse 5]**
Structural clinical data required and precise,
CSV, TSV, or XML, any format suffice,
Metadata for each variable defined,
Primary and secondary endpoints aligned,
EEG raw data pending your review,
MRI and radiological images too,
DICOM format for imaging care,
Clinical and radiological everywhere

Immunohistochemistry, OME-TIFF preferred state,
Bio-formats compatible, don't hesitate,
Immunofluorescence in the same sacred way,
Raw format data, forever to stay,
Flow cytometry optional, fsc files we share,
Gating parameters with utmost care,
In vitro drug screening, plate-based assay,
CSV or TSV template every day

Choose your format carefully, mon amour,
It will echo through the future, forever more,
Raw data is the gift we leave behind,
Reproducibility, knowledge combined,
Ask yourself the question soft and true,
Would I want this data if I weren't me, too?
Would I combine it, ask questions new?
Then it's key data, precious and true,
Then it's key data, I give to you

Fast-paced storytelling (120 BPM) with a raw, gritty male vocal delivery—raspy, defiant, and emotionally weathered. Deep twang with occasional growls and conversational spoken-word sections. Instrumentation: acoustic guitar fingerpicking, banjo, upright bass, and sparse drums with a rebellious edge. Dark, smoky atmosphere with themes of freedom, redemption, and life on the margins—tales of broken hearts, run-ins with the law, and refusing to fit society's mold. The mood is introspective yet wild, mixing melancholy with swagger. Vocals should feel lived-in and authentic, like whiskey and cigarette smoke.","# SYNAPSE OUTLAW

*(Spoken intro, raspy whisper)*
Listen close now, partner—I'm gonna tell you how to organize your data right...

*(Verse 1 - Fast, defiant)*
They approved my sharing plan, now I'm riding into Synapse town,
Repository project waiting, gonna lay my data down,
Building folders like a outlaw builds his hideaway,
Community standards guide me through the crooked way,
Top-level folders calling like a whiskey-soaked refrain,
Raw Data folder first, brother—that's the main terrain,
Subfolders organized by datasets I declared,
Manifest dot CSV sitting there, prepared,
Imaging, Cognitive Assessments, RNA-seq too,
Each one tagged with contentType equals dataset, true,
This structure's like a map through the wilderness so dark,
Makes annotation easier, leaves a proper mark.

*(Chorus)*
Synapse, Synapse, organize or die,
Keep your data flowing straight or watch it go awry,
Raw Data, Reporting, Analysis too,
Follow community standards or you'll rue the day you do,
Synapse, Synapse, structure's the key,
Governance applied clean, sets your data free.

*(Verse 2 - Conversational, worn-down tone)*
Now listen here—files can't sit direct under Raw Data's door,
They gotta live in folders, that's what folders are for,
Even if you only got one dataset type to show,
Put it in a subfolder, let that structure grow,
Batch one, batch two—organize by time,
French cohort, US cohort—geography's a sign,
RNA-seq data, different times it was made,
Group 'em by the batches, don't let standards fade,
If your Data Sharing Plan changes down the line,
Add or delete folders—keep that schema fine,
Add the contentType key-value pair yourself,
So the curation application finds your wealth.

*(Verse 3 - Raw, gravelly)*
Milestone Reports folder holds the summary sheets,
Links your data files to every milestone you meet,
Program officers upload their reports right here,
Generated by the coordination team, crystal clear,
Not like Raw Data folders—this don't need partition,
This one's for the funders with their funder's mission,
Data Sharing Plan folder—keep your versions stacked,
Every change you make, keep a copy tracked.

*(Verse 4 - Building intensity)*
Analysis folder—that's where protocols live,
Code and derived results, everything you give,
Docker Registry standing like a outlaw's stand,
Storing analysis code across the land,
Docker images carrying both code and soul,
Software dependencies—making broken systems whole,
Configurations bundled, reproducible and tight,
Making analysis reachable through the digital night,
See that Docker Registry, it's your distribution friend,
Making code more reproducible from start to end.

*(Chorus)*
Synapse, Synapse, organize or die,
Keep your data flowing straight or watch it go awry,
Raw Data, Reporting, Analysis too,
Follow community standards or you'll rue the day you do,
Synapse, Synapse, structure's the key,
Governance applied clean, sets your data free.

*(Spoken outro, slow and knowing)*
Other top-level folders—you can build 'em if you need,
Fall outside the scope, they'll be ignored indeed,
But follow this structure, partner, and you'll find,
Others understand your work, easy to find,
Easier to annotate, easier to govern right,
Synapse organization—that's the outlaw's light..."

**[Verse 1]**
Baby, let me tell you 'bout the data of my heart
It's information, oh, organized from the start
Metadata's the story that the data wants to tell
It's context and it's structure, baby, helps us use it well
The original contributors, they share what they know
The NF-OSI curates it, let that knowledge flow
Data about the data, that's what I'm singing for
Understanding what you're giving me, I'm asking for more

**[Pre-Chorus]**
(Oh, oh) You gotta know what's available
(Oh, oh) Make that data reusable
(Oh, oh) Every property matters
(Oh, oh) When the information scatters

**[Chorus]**
Metadata, metadata, you're the key to my soul
A manifest that shows me how to make data whole
Properties and properties describing what you hold
Assay, species, sample identifiers, never getting old
Metadata, metadata, in the Synapse interface
Every annotation helps me find my place
You're the context that I'm longing for
Metadata, baby, that's what I adore

**[Verse 2]**
There's a manifest, a summary CSV file
Listing every upload in the dataset, makes me smile
Each file has its properties, characterizing what's inside
Linked individual and sample identifiers, your guide
The metadata's available on every single file
You can see annotations in the web interface style
Compile it all together in a manifest to download
For your analysis and research, breaking through the cloud

**[Pre-Chorus]**
(Oh, oh) You gotta search and you gotta filter
(Oh, oh) In the Synapse web UI, deliver
(Oh, oh) Every annotation matches

(Oh, yeah) Find the data that you need
(Oh, yeah) Search and filter with precision
(Oh, yeah) That's my creed

**[Verse 3]**
When you want extensive clinical data, oh so deep
Individual-level patient demographics to keep
Phenotypes and assay data intertwined
Check the CSV files or Synapse tables, you will find
Contributors sometimes struggle sharing all the details
More restrictions on the clinical, but the effort never fails
If it's available, baby, that's where it will be
Connected to your analysis, setting knowledge free

Search precise, get it right, that's the remedy

Don't make mistakes on the spelling, that's the first rule
MySQL don't forgive, treat the search like school
One letter off, the whole query get rejected
Your results come back empty, man, you wasn't protected
Check your spelling twice before you hit that button
Sloppy typing in the database, that ain't nothin'

[HOOK]
Search it right, search it tight
Spelling gotta be precise, yeah, that's the life
No suffixes, no plurals, keep it singular, son
Search the portal correct, that's how it's done
Search it right, search it tight
Spelling gotta be precise, that's the fight

[VERSE 2]
Now listen, MySQL don't do no stemming, that's the truth
Don't identify the root of words, that's the proof
If you searchin' ""plexiform neurofibromas"" plural form
You won't get what you want, that's the system norm
Search ""plexiform neurofibroma"" singular instead
Drop the suffix, drop the 's', keep it in your head
Words like ""-ing"" gonna trap you in the dark
""Growing"" got ""grow"" inside but won't hit the mark

Four characters or less and it ain't exact
Short terms inside another word get attacked
You search ""NF1"" straight up, that's legit
But ""grow"" inside ""growing""? Nah, that won't hit
Search the exact match that you tryna find
Leave the suffixes behind, use your mind

[HOOK]
Search it right, search it tight
Spelling gotta be precise, yeah, that's the life
No suffixes, no plurals, keep it singular, son
Search the portal correct, that's how it's done
Search it right, search it tight
Spelling gotta be precise, that's the fight

[VERSE 3]
Running into problems? Man, don't suffer in silence
Reach out, contact support, break the violence
Email nf-osi at sagebionetworks dot org
File a ticket, click ""Need more help,"" don't ignore
Tell 'em what you're searchin', tell 'em what went wrong
Help the research community stay strong
They evaluatin' whether to upgrade the tech
ElasticSearch or keep it, gotta check the deck

Your feedback matter, make the database better
Every error report, every single letter
Computationally efficient, that's the current way
But they listenin' close to what users say
Might move to ElasticSearch if the need arise
Or keep the current search solution, analyze

[OUTRO - Heavy 808s fade]
Search it right, get it tight
Spelling precise, that's the light
Nah, nah, yeah
Portal searchin', portal searchin'
Keep it accurate, keep it workin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah"

Intimate fingerpicked acoustic guitar with warm, earthy production. Tempo: 90-110 BPM. Vocals: raw, conversational lead singing with gentle harmonies, slight vocal imperfections for authenticity. Add subtle strings (cello/violin) and light percussion (brushed drums, tambourine). Mood: nostalgic, reflective, melancholic yet hopeful. Themes: personal storytelling, nature, lost love, homecoming, generational wisdom. Fingerpicking patterns drive the melody while vocals sit naturally over minimal arrangements. Atmosphere evokes candlelit rooms and folk club intimacy. Think Dylan meets contemporary indie-folk sensibilities.","# The Data Portal Song

**Verse 1:**
Well, I came to the portal with a question in mind,
Looking for data that researchers could find,
The Neurofibromatosis organization's been sharing their way,
Transformed into new forms of value every day,
But the real treasure lies in what we do with it all,
When community members answer the call,
Reanalyzing, reusing in ways yet untold,
New knowledge and insights waiting to unfold.

**Chorus:**
There's so many pathways, so many roads,
Different environments carrying different loads,
Some with official support running deep,
Others emerging where the community keeps,
Their eyes on adoption, on what really works,
Where the value of sharing never shirks,
So many tools and so many ways,
To turn raw data into brighter days.

**Verse 2:**
There's cBioPortal for visualization's sake,
Interactive genomics for the choices you make,
Explore your cohorts, screen mutations quick,
Web interface makes it click, click, click,
But customize deeply? Well, that's not its call,
Only certain datasets available to all,
For exploratory work it shines so bright,
Clinical summaries and summaries right.

**Verse 3:**
Cavatica came in since twenty twenty-four,
Synapse integration opened up the door,
Collaborative workspaces, ergonomic and clean,
Pre-built environments you've never seen,
R and Python ready for your genomics dreams,
Collaborative projects flowing like streams,
But watch for the cloud costs climbing high,
And the learning curve reaching for the sky.

**Verse 4:**
Pluto dot bio's coming soon, they say,
End of twenty twenty-five, early twenty twenty-six way,
Off-the-shelf pipelines, nf-core included,
Standard genomics workflows, beautifully suited,
Easy collaboration, guided analysis too,
But pipeline flexibility? Limited for you,
And the cloud costs will knock on your door,
Newer platform means there's always more to explore.

**Verse 5:**
Terra dot bio's got thousands of pipelines stored,
Collaborative projects that can be poured,
Into custom analyses, grant-funded ways,
Synapse integration coming in future days,
Twenty twenty-six is when they'll connect,
Data Repository Service, what you'd expect,
No manual downloads, no upload dance,
Authorization once gives data a chance.

**Verse 6:**
If you've got an institution with high-performance computing,
Command line and API, that's what you're doing,
High computational power, flexible tools to install,
Large-scale workflows, you can do it all,
Familiar environment, institution-specific access,
But collaboration and reproduction? Less and less,
Harder to share your work externally,
Though the power runs deep internally.

**Verse 7:**
Private clouds on Amazon, Google, or Azure too,
Self-managed compute, the scalable view,
Cloud storage transfer, collaborative sharing,
Custom environments, analysis daring,
But you need the expertise, the knowledge to grow,
And cloud costs will follow wherever you go,
For team collaborations, for scaling your dreams,
Nothing quite works like those cloud computing streams.

**Verse 8:**
Your local machine, it's intimate and small,
Complete control over it all,
Offline analysis, proof-of-concept work,
Small datasets where your methods lurk,
But hardware limitations will find you quick,
Large datasets make it slow and thick,
Sharing your work becomes the hardest part,
Though it's where many analyses start.

**Verse 9:**
Code Ocean builds reproducibility's case,
Standard pipelines in a managed space,
Nf-core workflows, publication-ready flows,
Reproducible research is how it goes,
Staff evaluated, they've looked it through,
Pay-per-compute model for you,
Standardized methods, that's the dream,
Where research integrity runs supreme.

**Verse 10:**
Biomni, FutureHouse, Jataware Biome,
Agentic artificial intelligence systems, they roam,
Staff evaluated, still in development's way,
More analysis than raw data processing, they say,
Application programming interface costs will rise,
But the future of analysis before our eyes,
Still emerging, still taking their form,
Where intelligent agents become the norm.

**Verse 11:**
Now listen close to Data Repository Service,
It's a standardized application programming interface with purpose,
Secure direct data access between places,
Eliminates manual downloads, saves storage spaces,
Authorize connection just one single time,
Data appears in your workspace, no climb,
Faster workflow setup, that's the gain,
Better data provenance running through your vein.

**Verse 12:**
With DRS you don't wait for the download to creep,
Reduced storage costs, your budget you keep,
Automatic permission enforcement too,
The analysis platform knows what's true,
Without DRS, well, here's how it goes,
Download from Synapse, then upload, who knows,
Manual file transfers, command line and more,
But that's how self-managed compute keeps score.

**Verse 13:**
So reach out to nf-osi at sagebionetworks dot org,
Share your experience, suggest what will forge,
Community improvements, ask your questions..."
